# Contributing to ORM

## Local development

ORM can be developed locally. I personally use the following environment:

- Visual Studio 2017 Community

This project already has a pre-configured .editorconfig file, so that the configuration of the code style will be automatically loaded by Visual Studio, and code that violates the code style rule won't pass compile.
Because this project is based on the .NET standard and the .NET core, you can also try to choose other development environments.
