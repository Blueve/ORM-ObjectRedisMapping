ObjectRedisMapping(ORM) is an object-redis mapper that enables .NET developers to work with a Redis database using .NET objects. It eliminating the need for most of the data-access code and Redis schema design that developers usually need to write.

This is a toy project developed out of personal interest. I will try to use this project to experiment with some problemes in my work. Although I have no way to apply the technology used in this project in my work, I believe that the experience I gained in developing this project will be of great benefit to me.

If you are interested in this project too, you are welcome to put forward your suggestions in [Issues](https://github.com/Blueve/ORM-ObjectRedisMapping/issues) and you are also welcome to contribute this project with me.

SINCE THIS PROJECT IS UNDER DEVELOPING, THE SHOW CASE BELOW IS JUST FOR PREVIEW THE API AND THE USAGE.

## Show Case

Store to Redis
```csharp
var person1 = new Person
{
    Name = "Tom",
    Age = 18
};
var person2 = new Person
{
    Name = "Jerry",
    Age = 10
};
person1.Partner = person2;
person2.Partner = person1;

dbContext.Commit(person1);

// Redis
// PersonTom -> True
// PersonTomName -> Tom
// PersonTomeAge -> 18
// PersonTomPartner -> Jerry
// PersonJerry -> True
// PersonJerryName -> Jerry
// PersonJerryAge -> 10
// PersonJerryPartner -> Tom
```

Fetch from Redis
```csharp
var person = dbContext.Find("Tom");
Console.WriteLine(person.Partern.Name); // Jerry
Console.WriteLine(person.Partern.Age); // 10
Console.WriteLine(person.Partern.Partern.Name); // Tom
Console.WriteLine(person.Partern.Partern.Name); // 18
```

Update in place by a dynmic proxy
```csharp
var person = dbContext.Find("Jerry");
person.Age = 18;

// Redis
// PersonJerryAge -> 18
```

Store a linked-list
```csharp
var head = new ListNode
{
    Val = 1,
    Next = new ListNode
    {
        Val = 2,
        Next = new ListNode
        {
            Val = 3
        }
    }
};
dbContext.Commit(head);

// Redis
// ListNode1 -> True
// ListNode1Val -> 1
// ListNode1Next -> 2
// ListNode2 -> True
// ListNode2Val -> 2
// ListNode2Next -> 3
// ListNode3 -> True
// ListNode3Val -> 3
```
